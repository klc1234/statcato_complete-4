  <p>
      The trimmed mean of a data set is the mean of the data set in which
      a certain percentage of extreme values are removed.  The <i>x</i>%
      trimmed mean is found by arranging the data in order, deleting 
      the top <i>x</i>% and the bottom <i>x</i>% of the values, and then
      calculating the mean of the remaining values.
