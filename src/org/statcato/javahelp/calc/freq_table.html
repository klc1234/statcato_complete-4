      <h1>Calculate > Frequency Table</h1>
      <p>
          This utility computes the frequencies of data belonging to 
          different categories or classes.  You must provide the data 
          (category names or numbers) to be counted in
          a column.  If the data is numerical, you must provide the 
          upper limits of the classes for which frequencies are computed.
          The categories/classes and their corresponding frequencies are 
          computed and stored in columns specified by the user.
      </p>
      <h3>Dialog Inputs</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Source Data:</b>  Select the column containing input data 
          in the <b>Compute frequency data for column:</b> drop-down menu.</li>
          <li><b>Methods of Computing Frequencies:</b>  Choose one of the following:
          <ul>
              <li>Treat source data as categories.  Count the frequency 
              of each category.</li>
              <li>Source data contains numerical data.  Count the frequency
              of each class, where the upper class limits are provided
              (you must select the column containing the upper class limits
              in the corresponding drop-down menu).</li>
              <li>Source data contains numerical data.  Count the frequency
              of each class, where the classes are defined by the first 
              upper class limit and the class width.  The number of
              classes can also be provided; if it is not provided, 
              the number of classes is the smallest number such that 
              all samples can be classified.</li>
              <li>Source data
              contains numerical data.  Automatically use 10 classes,
              with the first lower class limit decided by the minimum value.
              The class width is (maximum value - minimum value) / 10.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Store Frequency Table in:</b>  Enter the column name 
          (e.g. C1) or variable name for storing the categories and frequencies.
          </li>
      </ul>
