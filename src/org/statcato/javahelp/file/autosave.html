      <h1>Auto Save Feature</h1>
      <p>
          The program automatically saves a back up copy of the
          current project file at one minute after the start of the
          program execution.  The back up file is saved in the
          same directory as the program files and is named in the
          form ~statcato.tmp.mmddyyyyhhmmss.stc, where mmddyyyyhhmmss
          is a timestamp of when the file is created.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, auto save happens every five minutes.
            You can change the frequency by going to
            <a href="options.html">File > Options</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the back up file is retained after the
            application exits.  If you would like the back up file to be
            deleted after the application exits, you can change the
            auto save options by going to
            <a href="options.html">File > Options</a>.
