      <h1>Graph > Stem-and-Leaf Plot</h1>
      <p>
      A stem-and-leaf plot divides each data value into a stem and a leaf
      and shows the leaves corresponding to each distinct stem in the data
      set in a tabular fashion.  Like a histogram, the frequency of 
      each category (each stem in a stem-and-leaf plot) can be easily seen.
      However, unlike a histogram, the individual data value can be 
      retrieved from the plot by combining each stem with its corresponding 
      leaves.  For example, for the values {1.5, 2.3, 4.5, 4.8, 6.5, 8.5, 8.8, 9.5},
      the stem-and-leaf plot is<br>
      <table border="1">
        <tr><td align="right">Stem</td><td>Leaves</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">1</td><td>5</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">2</td><td>3</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">3</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">4</td><td>58</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">5</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">6</td><td>5</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">7</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">8</td><td>58</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="right">9</td><td>5</td></tr>
        </table>
        </p>
        <p>
        In this plot, the unit of each leaf is 0.1.  The individual data value 
        can be found by appending the stem to each of its leaf.
        Stems with no leaves are inserted between 
        the first and the last stem so that
        all stems are evenly spaced.
    </p>
  <p>
      The stem-and-leaf graph utility allows the user to specify a number of
      graph variables and an optional variable that groups the data into
      a number of categories.
      It also provides the options of specifying the leaf unit, whether
      the outliers should be excluded, and whether the stems with no leaves
      should be displayed.  The leaf unit must be equal to 10<sup><i>x</i></sup>
      where <i>x</i> is an integer.  Outliers are those that fall outside of 
      the interval [first quartile - 1.5 * IQR, third quartile + 1.5 * IQR],
      where IQR is the interquartile range.

   <h2>Dialog Inputs</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>To open the stem-and-leaf utility, select 
      <b>Graph > Stem-and-Leaf Plot</b>.</li>
      <li>Select the columns containing data values under <b>Graph Variables</b> list.  
      Control-click to select multiple variables.
      A separate plot is 
      created for each column of values if no Group-by variable is selected
      (see next item).</li>
      <li>If the data values have their corresponding category labels in 
      a separate column, select the column of the category labels in
        the <b>Group By Categories in</b> drop-down menu.  A separate plot
        is created for data values belonging to each category label.</li>
        <li>[optional] Enter the <b>leaf unit</b> 
        (must be equal to 10<sup><i>x</i></sup>,
        where <i>x</i> is an integer).  If the leaf unit is not specified,
        it will be determined by the following method: A leaf unit for 
        a data value is the place to the right of the first non-zero
        digit of the value (<i>e.g.</i>The leaf unit of 141 is 10, and 
        the leaf unit of 0.023 is 0.001).  The leaf unit for a set of data values is
        the maximum of the leaf units of the individual data values.</li>
    <li>Select the <b>Exclude outliers</b> checkbox to exclude the outliers
    from the plot.</li>
    <li>Select the <b>Display stems that have no leaves</b> checkbox to 
    display the stems with no leaves.</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> to create the stem-and-leaf plot.  The plot will be
    displayed in the log window.</li>
    </ul>
