      <h1>Graph > Box Plot</h1>
      <p>
      A box plot shows the five-number summaries of a group
      of data values (minimum, first quartile, median,
      third quartile, and maximum).  The outliers and farout values are 
      shown outside of the box.  Outliers are values that are 
      of distances more than 1.5 * IQR (inter-quartile range) but less than
      or equal to 2 * IQR
      from the first quartile or the third
      quartile.  Farouts are values that are of distances more than 2 * IQR
      from the first quartile or the third quartile.
