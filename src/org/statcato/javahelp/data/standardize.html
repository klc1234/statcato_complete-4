  <h1>Data > Standardize</h1>
  <p>
      The <b>Standardize</b> utility performs data transformation 
      on columns of data, including scaling and moving the center of data
      in a column, as well as adjusting the range of the data.
  </p>
  <p>
      To use the utility, select <b>Data > Standardize&#0133;</b>.
      <ul>
          <li>In the <b>Input Column(s)</b> text box, enter the names
      of the columns.  Separate column names by spaces (e.g. c2  c4),
      and use a dash to indicate a range of columns (e.g. c10-c15).</li> 
          <li>In the <b>Store results in column(s)</b> text box, 
          enter valid column names where the results will be stored.
          The number of input columns must be the same as
        the number of columns for storing results.
        The results of standardizing the input column(s) will be
    stored in the store columns in order.</li>

      <li>Select one of the following options:
      <ul>
          <li><b>Subtract mean and divide by standard deviation</b>:
          For each number in the column, subtract the mean of the 
          column data set and divide by the standard deviation.</li>
          <li><b>Subtract &#0133; Then divide by &#0133;</b>: 
          For each number in the column, subtract the first specified
      number and then divide by the second specified number.</li>
          <li><b>Make range From: &#0133; To: &#0133;</b>: For
          each number in the column, shift and scale so that the range of
          the data goes from <b>From</b> to <b>To</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Click OK to finish.</li>
      </li>
      </ul>
