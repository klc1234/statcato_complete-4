      <h1>Manipulate Data > Generate Patterned Data</h1>
        Statcato provides utilities for generating two types of 
        patterned data: (1) Simple number sequence, in which numbers
        differed by a common step size are repeated individually or as a sequence; 
        and (2) arbitrary data sequence, in which arbitrary data values
        are repeated individually or as a sequence.
