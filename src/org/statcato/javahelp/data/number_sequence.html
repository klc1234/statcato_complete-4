      <h1>Manipulate Data > Generate Patterned Data > Simple Number Sequence</h1>
      <p>
      This utility generates a simple number sequence in a column.  The sequence
      consists of repetitions of terms that are differed by a constant step size.
      To use this utility, you will specify the column for storing the sequence,
      the first and last value of the
      sequence, the step size, the number of times a value is repeated, and 
      the number of times the whole sequence of values is repeated.  
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The utility can be accessed from 
            <b>Data > Generate Patterned Data > Simple Number Sequence</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Store number pattern in:</b> The 
            column names in which the numbers will be stored, separated
        by spaces (e.g. c1 c3 c7).  For a continuous range of columns, specify using
        the first column, a dash, and the last column (e.g. C1-C30) </li>
        <li><b>From first number:</b> The first number in the sequence</li>
        <li><b>To last number:</b> The last number in the sequence</li>
        <li><b>In steps of:</b> The difference between two terms (step size)</li>
        <li><b>Number of times to list each number</b>: The number of times
        each term appears in the sequence (continuously)</li>
        <li><b>Number of times to list each sequence</b>:   The number of times the
        sequence, from the first to the last value, is repeated   
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            Given the inputs (From first number: 1, To last number: 10,
            In steps of: 2, Number of times to list each number: 2, Number of times
            to list each sequence: 2) produces the following sequence:
            1 1 3 3 5 5 7 7 9 9 1 1 3 3 5 5 7 7 9 9.
