      <h1>Statistics > Analysis of Variance</h1>
  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests the equality of three or more population
  means by analyzing sample variances.  It compares two different estimates
  of the variance common to the different populations.  The utilities in this 
  menu perform one-way ANOVA, where only one characteristic
  (also referred to as factor or treatment) is used to categorize the populations, 
  and two-way ANOVA, where data are categorized into groups according to two
  factors.
