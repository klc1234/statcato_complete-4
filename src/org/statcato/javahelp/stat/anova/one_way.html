      <h1>Statistics > Analysis of Variance > One-Way ANOVA</h1>
      <p>
  One-way analysis of variance uses one factor to categorize three or more 
  populations.  It is used to test hypotheses that three or more population means
  are equal.  The null hypothesis <i>H<sub>0</sub></i> is 
  <i>&mu;<sub>1</sub> = &mu;<sub>2</sub> = ... = &mu;<sub>k</sub></i>,
  where <i>&mu;<sub>i</sub></i> is the mean of population <i>i</i> of 
  <i>k</i> populations.  
</p>
    <p>
        The test statistic F is the ratio of two estimates of the variance
        common to the <i>k</i> populations:        
    </p>

    <p>When the null hypothesis is true, it has an <i>F</i> distribution 
    with degrees of freedom given by </p>
    <p><center>numerator degrees of freedom = <i>k - 1</i></center></p>
    <p><center>denominator degrees of freedom = <i>N - k</i></center></p>
    <p>The test statistics <i>F</i> can be expressed as the ratio
    MS(treatment) / MS (error).  
    The mean square (MS) and sum of squares (SS) are computed in order to 
    obtain <i>F</i>.
</p>
<p>
    SS(treatment) is a sum of squares representing the 
    variation between the sample means:   
</p>
<p><center><img src="SStreatment.gif"></center></p>
<p>where <i>n<sub>i</sub></i> is the size of sample <i>i</i>, 
<img src="xbar.gif"> is the mean of sample <i>i</i>,  
<img src="xbarbar.gif">, and <i>N</i> is the sum of all sample sizes.
</p>
<p>
    SS(error) is a sum of squares representing the variation that is assumed to 
    be common to the populations:
</p>
<p><center><img src="SSerror.gif"></center></p>
<p>
    SS(total) is a measure of the total variation in all the sample data:
</p>
<p><center>SS(total) = SS(treatment) = SS(error)</center></p>
<p>
    MS(treatment) is the mean square for treatment:
</p>
<p><center><img src="MStreatment.gif"></center></p>
<p>
    MS(error) is the mean square for error:
</p>
<p><center><img src="MSerror.gif"></center></p>

To use this utility, you will need to provide sample values for different
populations in separate columns and specify the significance level.
The SS and MS values are displayed along with the test statistic, critical
value, and p-Value.

  <h3>Dialog Inputs</h3>
  <p>To include a column in the analysis, select the column name in the
  <b>Select the column to be included in the analysis:</b> list and click
  the <b>Add to list</b> button.  The selected column(s) will be added to the
  <b>Responses</b> list.  To remove a column from the <b>Responses</b>
  list, select it and click the <b>Remove from list</b> button.
  Ctrl-click or shift-click to select multiple columns.
</p>
<p>
    Click the <b>Clear Input List</b> button to clear the input list.
</p>
<p>
    Enter the signicance level (a number between 0 and 1) in the 
    <b>Significance level</b> text box.
