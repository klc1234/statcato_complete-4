      <h1>Statistics > Confidence Intervals > 2-Population Variance</h1>
      <p>
          This utility computes the confidence intervals for the ratio
          of two population variances (&sigma;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> / 
          &sigma;<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>).  The confidence
          intervals are calculated using the following formula:

        where <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>s<sub>2</sub></i> are the sample
        standard deviations of two population samples, <i>F<sub>L</sub></i>
        is the lower critical value (inverse F probability distribution at
        &alpha;/2, where &alpha; is the significance level), and 
        <i>F<sub>R</sub></i>
        is the upper critical value (inverse F probability distribution at
        1 - &alpha;/2).

      <h3>Dialog Inputs</h3>
      <p>
          The sample data 
          can be inputted in one of three ways:
          <ul>
              <li><b>Samples in one column</b>: The population labels
              of samples are in one column of the Datasheet, 
              and the individual samples
              are in another column.</li>
              <li><b>Samples in two columns</b>: The samples of the two
              population are in two separate columns.</li>
              <li><b>Summarized sample data:</b> The sample size and
              standard deviation/variance of each sample
              are provided (instead of individual sample values).</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          The confidence level must be between 0 and 1.  For example,
          enter 0.95 for a 95% confidence level.
