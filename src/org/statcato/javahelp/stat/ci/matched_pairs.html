      <h1>Statistics > Confidence Intervals > Matched Pairs</h1>
      
      <p>
          This utility computes confidence intervals for the
          mean of the differences between matched pairs.
          The confidence interval estimate of the mean of 
          the differences between matched paris &mu;<sub>d</sub> is:

          where the margin of error <i>E</i> is given by 
          <img src="E_matched_pairs.gif">, <img src="d_bar.gif"> is 
          the mean of the differences between sample matched pairs, 
          and <img src="mu_d.gif"> is the mean of the differences
          between population matched pairs. 
      </p>
      <h3>Dialog Inputs</h3>
      <p>
          The sample data can be inputted in one of two ways:
          <ul>
              <li><b>Samples in columns</b>: 
              The sample matched pairs are provided in
              two columns, and the two values in a matched pair
              are provided in the same row.  
              Select the column containing values of
              the first sample in <b>First Sample:</b> drop-down menu.
              Select the column containing values of the second sample 
              in <b>Second Sample:</b> drop-down menu.
              <li><b>Summarized Sample Data</b>: The sample size,
              mean, and standard deviation
              are provided (instead of individual sample values).</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          The confidence level must be between 0 and 1.  For example,
          enter 0.95 for a 95% confidence level.
