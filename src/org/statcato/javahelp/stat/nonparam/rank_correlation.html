      <h1>Statistics > Nonparametrics > Spearman's Rank Correlation</h1>
      <p>
          This utility performs computations for the Spearman's
          rank correlation test, which is a nonparametric test that uses
          ranks of two samples.
          To use this
          utility, you must provide the sample paired data in two separate
          columns.  You must also provide the significance level for 
          the hypothesis test for correlation.
      </p>
      <p>
          The ranks of the data values are computed for each of the two
          samples.  Let <i>x</i> be the ranks of sample 1 and
          <i>y</i> be the ranks of sample 2.  The rank correlation coefficient
          is computed as follows:

          The critical value is
      </p>

      <p> where <i>t</i>
          is the inverse probability distribution of (1 - significance / 2)
          in the Student's t distribution with <i>n - 2</i>
          degress of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
          The p-value of the test statistic is obtained using a Student's t
          distribution with <i>n - 2</i> degrees of freedom.
