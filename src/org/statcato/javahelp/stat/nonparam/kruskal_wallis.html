      <h1>Statistics > Nonparametrics > Kruskal-Wallis Test</h1>
      This utility performs calculations for the Krustal-Wallis Test,
      which is a non-parametric test that uses ranks of sample data from three
      or more independent populations to test the null hypothesis that
      the independent samples come from populations with the same distribution.
        The null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> of a claim is that the samples
        come from populations with the same distribution (the population
        medians are all equal).
        The alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub> is that the samples come
        from populations with different distributions (the population
        medians are not all equal).
  </p>
  <p>
      Let <i>k</i> be the number of samples, and
      <i>N</i> be the total number of observations in all <i>k</i> samples combined.

      Let <i>n<sub>i</sub></i> be the size of sample <i>i</i>.
      The <i>k</i> samples are
      combined into one and then ranked, with the smallest sample given rank 1,
      second rank 2, etc.  If two or more samples are tied, their ranks are
      averaged.  Let <i>R<sub>i</sub></i> be the sum of ranks for sample <i>i</i>.

      The test uses an approximation by a Chi-square distribution with <i>k - 1</i>
      degrees of freedom and computes the right-tailed p-value and critical value.

      To use the utility, you must provide at least three samples, each with at least
      five observations (if a sample of fewer than five observations is used,
      a note indicating the presence of small samples will be shown).
