      <h1>Statistics > Nonparametrics > Runs Test</h1>
      This utility performs calculations for the runs test,
      which is a non-parametric test that uses the number of runs 
      in a sequence of sample data to test for randomness in the order of the 
      data.  A run is a sequence of data belonging to the same category.
        The null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> of a claim is that the sequence is
        random.
        The alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub> is that the sequence
        is not random.
  </p>
  <p>
      Each data value can be categorized into one of two separate categories.
      For example, the two categories can be text descriptions
      &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.  For numerical data, the two categories
      can be defined to be above and below a certain numerical value, such
      as the mean.
  </p>
  <p>
      Let <i>n<sub>1</sub></i> be the number of samples
      belonging to the first category.
      Let <i>n<sub>2</sub></i> be the number of samples
      belonging to the second category.
      Let <i>G</i> be the number of runs.

      Using normal approximation, the test statistic z is

  <p>
      The two-tailed p-value and critical value are provided in the test
      results.
  </p>
  <p>
      To use the utility, you must provide the sample data in a single column
      or provide the summary data.
      
      If a sample of fewer than ten observations is used,
      a note indicating the presence of small samples will be shown.

  <ul>
      <li>If data samples are provided in a column, select the
      <b>Samples in one column</b> radio button and select
      the column name in the coresponding drop-down menu.</li>
      <li>If summarized data is provided, select the
      <b>Summarized sample data</b> radio button and provide
      the number of category 1 elements, the number of category 2 elements,
      and the number of runs.</li>
      <li>Provide the significance level of the test (between 0 and 1).</li>
      <li>If data samples are provided, the <b>Data Options</b> panel will be
      shown.  Select the <b>Categorical</b> radio button if the samples
      contain exactly two categories.  If the samples contain numerical values,
      select the <b>Numerical</b>
      radio button  and then
      select the appropriate radio button to categorize
      the numerical data into above and below the mean or a specified value.
    </li>    
    <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to perform the computation.  The 
    results will be displayed in the log window.</li>
  </ul>
