      <h1>Statistics > Nonparametrics > 2-Sample Matched-Pair Sign Test</h1>
      This utility performs calculations for testing claims about two population
      means for the case when the type of
      population distribution cannot be assumed, except that the population
      of the pairwise differences is symmetric.
        The null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> of a claim is
        &mu;<sub>1</sub>= &mu;<sub>2</sub>.
        The alternative
      hypothesis H<sub>1</sub>
      can be one of the following: 
      &mu;<sub>1</sub> &lt; &mu;<sub>2</sub>,
      &mu;<sub>1</sub> &gt; &mu;<sub>2</sub>, or
      &mu;<sub>1</sub> &ne; &mu;<sub>2</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>
      A positive difference is assigned a positive (+) sign.
      A negative difference is assigned a negative (-) sign.
      The test statistic is computed as follows:
      <ul>
          <li>Left-tailed (H<sub>1</sub>: &mu;<sub>1</sub> &lt; &mu;<sub>2</sub>):
          s = the number of positive (+) signs</li>
          <li>Right-tailed (H<sub>1</sub>: &mu;<sub>1</sub> &gt; &mu;<sub>2</sub>):
          s = the number of negative (-) signs</li>
          <li>Two-tailed (H<sub>1</sub>: &mu;<sub>1</sub> &ne; &mu;<sub>2</sub>):
          s = the minimum of the number of (+) signs and the number of
          (-) signs
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
      The p-value for a one-tailed test (left-tailed or right-tailed) is
      <i>P(X &le; s)</i> where <i>X</i> is a random variable representing the number
      of positive signs.  The-value for a two-tailed test is
      <i>2P(X &le; s)</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
      If the sample size <i>n</i> (excluding values that are equal to the hypothesized
      mean) is not more than 50, exact binomial probability calculations
      are used to compute the p-value.  If the sample size is greater than
      50, the normal distribution is used as an approximation to binomial:

      To use the utility, follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>If individual samples are entered in two columns of the
  Datasheet, select the <b>Samples in column:</b> radio button, and
  select the column names in the drop-down menu.</li>
  <li>To use summary statistics of the sample data, select the 
  <b>Summarized sample data:</b> radio button, and input the number
  of positive signs and the number of negative signs in the provided text fields.</li>
    <li>Select the form of the alternative hypothesis in the
    <b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b> drop-down menu. </li>
    <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to perform the computation.  The 
    results will be displayed in the log window.</li>
  </ul>
