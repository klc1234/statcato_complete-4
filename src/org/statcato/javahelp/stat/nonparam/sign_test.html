      <h1>Statistics > Nonparametrics > 1-Sample Sign Test</h1>
      This utility performs calculations for testing claims about a population
      median for the case when the type of
      population distribution cannot be assumed.
        The null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> of a claim is median = median<sub>0</sub>,
        where median<sub>0</sub> is the hypothesized median.
        The alternative
      hypothesis H<sub>1</sub>
      can be one of the following: median &lt; median<sub>0</sub>,
      median &gt; median<sub>0</sub>, or median &ne; median<sub>0</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>
      A sample value above median<sub>0</sub> is assigned a positive (+) sign.
      A sample value below median<sub>0</sub> is assigned a negative (-) sign.
      The test statistic is computed as follows:
      <ul>
          <li>Left-tailed (H<sub>1</sub>: median &lt; median<sub>0</sub>):
          s = the number of positive (+) signs</li>
          <li>Right-tailed (H<sub>1</sub>: median &gt; median<sub>0</sub>):
          s = the number of negative (-) signs</li>
          <li>Two-tailed (H<sub>1</sub>: median &ne; median<sub>0</sub>):
          s = the minimum of the number of (+) signs and the number of
          (-) signs
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
      The p-value for a one-tailed test (left-tailed or right-tailed) is
      <i>P(X &le; s)</i> where <i>X</i> is a random variable representing the number
      of positive signs.  The p-value for a two-tailed test is
      <i>2P(X &le; s)</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
      If the sample size <i>n</i> (excluding values that are equal to the hypothesized
      mean) is not more than 50, exact binomial probability calculations
      are used to compute the p-value.  If the sample size is greater than
      50, the normal distribution is used as an approximation to binomial:

      To use the utility, follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>If individual samples are entered in a single column of the 
  Datasheet, select the <b>Samples in column:</b> radio button, and
  select the column name in the drop-down menu.</li>
  <li>To use summary statistics of the sample data, select the 
  <b>Summarized sample data:</b> radio button, and input the number
  of positive signs and the number of negative signs in the provided text fields.</li>
    <li>Select the form of the alternative hypothesis in the
    <b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b> drop-down menu.  Enter the 
    hypothesized population median in the provided text box.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to perform the computation.  The 
    results will be displayed in the log window.</li>
  </ul>
