      <h1>Statistics > Multinomial > Cross Tabulation and Chi-Square</h1>
      <p>
      This utility performs cross tabulation and shows the joint distribution
      of two variables given individual observations and
      optionally the frequency of each
      observation.  The joint distribution is displayed in a contingency
      table, which can be stored in a datasheet for further processing.
      The option to perform a
      <a href="contingency_table.html">Chi-square test on the contingency table </a>
      is also provided.
        </p>

        <p>
    To use this utility, you will need to provide the observations
    in two columns (the values of the first
    variable in one column, and the corresponding values of the second
    variable in a second column).  You may optionally provide the
    frequency corresponding to each observation in a third column.
        </p>

  <h3>Dialog Inputs</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Select the columns containing row and column labels of the
      observations in the provided drop-down menus.</li>
      <li>If frequencies of the observations are available, select
      the column containing the frequencies in the provided drop-down menu.
      </li>
      <li>To perform a Chi-square test, select the coresponding checkbox
      and provide the significance level of the test.</li>
      <li>To store the resulting contingency table in a new datasheet,
      select the corresponding checkbox.</li>
  </ul>
