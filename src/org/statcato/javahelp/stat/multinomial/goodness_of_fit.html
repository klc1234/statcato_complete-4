      <h1>Statistics > Multinomial > Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit</h1>
      <p>
      The Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test determines whether 
      an observed frequency distribution agrees with some claimed distribution.
      It applies to data of different categories resulting from a multinomial
      experiment.  The test statistic for Goodness-of-Fit tests in 
      multinomial experiments is

      </p>
      <p>When using this utility, you must provide the observed frequencies
      (frequency counts or categorical data) and the expected frequencies or
      probabilities.
      You must also provide the confidence level of the test.

      <h3>Dialog Inputs</h3>
      <h4>Observed Frequencies</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>If the frequency counts of the different categories are
          in one column of the Datasheet, select the <b>Frequencies in 
          Column:</b> radio button and select the column in the drop-down menu.
          If the category names corresponding to the frequency counts are
          also in one column of the Datasheet, you can optionally select the
          column containing the category names in the drop-down menu.
          </li>
          <li>If the categorical data are in one column (instead of frequency 
          counts), selet the <b>Categorical Data in Column:</b>
          radio button and select the column in the drop-down menu.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Expected Frequencies</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>If the different categories of data are expected to have the 
          same frequency, select the <b>Equal Frequencies</b> radio button.</li>
          <li>If unequal frequencies are expected, select the <b>Unequal
          Frequencies</b> radio button.  If the expected frequencies are provided,
          select the column containing the
          expected frequencies in the <b>Frequencies in Column</b> 
            drop-down menu.
            If the expected probabilities are given, select the column containing
            the probabilities in the <b>Probabilities in Column</b> drop-down 
        menu.</li>
        <li>If a past sample of categorical data is available, select the 
            <b>Categorical Data</b> radio button.  Select the column containing
            the categorical data values in the <b>Past Sample Data in Column</b>
            drop-down menu.
            </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Significance Level</h4>
      <p>Enter the significance level in the given
      text box.  The significance level must be between 0 and 1.</p>
