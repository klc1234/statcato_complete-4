      <h1>Statistics > Hypothesis Tests > 1-Population Mean</h1>
      This utility performs calculations for testing claims about a population
      mean for the case population standard deviation &sigma; is known and
      the case when &sigma; is unknown.  The population is assumed to be
      normally distributed.  The null hypothesis of a claim about a
      population mean &mu; is &mu = &mu<sub>0</sub>.  The alternative
      hypothesis can be one of the following: &mu &lt; &mu<sub>0</sub>,
      &mu &gt; &mu<sub>0</sub>, or &mu; &ne; &mu<sub>0</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>
      When &sigma; is known, the standard normal distribution is used to
      calculate p-Values and critical values.  The test statistic is computed
      using the following formula:

  <p>
      where <img src="xbar.gif"> is the sample mean, &mu;
      is the hypothesized population mean, and <i>n</i> is the sample size.
  </p>
  <p>
      When &sigma; is unknown, the Student's t distribution with degrees of
      freedom <i>n - 1</i>, where <i>n</i> is the sample size, is used to 
      compute p-Values and critical values.  The test statistic is computed
      as follows:
  </p>

  </center>
  <p>
      where <i>s</i> is the sample standard deviation.
  </p>
  <p>
      To use the utility, follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Population standard deviation:</b> Select the <b>Known</b>
      radio button if the population standard deviation is known and
      enter the standard deviation in the provided text field.  If it is
  unknown, select the <b>Unknown</b> radio button.</li>
  <li>If individual samples are entered in a single column of the 
  Datasheet, select the <b>Samples in column:</b> radio button, and
  select the column name in the drop-down menu.</li>
  <li>To use summary statistics of the sample data, select the 
  <b>Summarized sample data:</b> radio button, and input the sample size,
mean, and standard deviation in the provided text fields.</li>
    <li>Enter the significance or confidence level (between 0 and 1).</li>
    <li>Select the form of the alternative hypothesis in the
    <b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b> drop-down menu.  Enter the 
    hypothesized population mean in the provided text box.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to perform the computation.  The 
    results will be displayed in the log window.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Sample Outputs</h3>
  <p>
      The null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are displayed.
      The results, along with the input parameters, are displayed in a table.
      <br>
      [N = sample size; Sample Mean = calculated from the individual samples
      or provided directly by the user; Stdev = s for sample standard
      deviation, or &sigma; for population standard deviation; 
      Significance Level = 1 - confidence level; Critical Value = 
      critical value corresponding to the significance level; 
      Test Statistic = test statistic corresponding to the hypothesized mean; 
      p-Value = p-Value corresponding to the test statistic]
