      <h1>Statistics > Hypothesis Test > Matched Pairs</h1>
      
      <p>
        This utility performs calculations for testing claims about the
      mean of the differences between a population of matched pairs.  
      The population is assumed to be
      approximately normal.  The null hypothesis of a claim about a
      population mean &mu; is &mu; = &mu;<sub>d</sub>.  The alternative
      hypothesis can be one of the following: &mu; &lt; &mu;<sub>d</sub>,
      &mu; &gt; &mu;<sub>d</sub>, or &mu; &ne; &mu;<sub>d</sub>.
      </p>
      <p>
          The hypothesis test statistic is given by:

      </p>
      <p>
          where <img src="d_bar.gif"> is 
          the mean of the differences between sample matched pairs, 
          <i>s<sub>d</sub></i> is the standard deviation of the differences
          between sample matched pairs, and <i>n</i> is the number of
          matched pairs.  The degrees of freedom is <i>n - 1</i>.
      </p>
      <h3>Dialog Inputs</h3>
      <p>
          The sample data can be inputted in one of two ways:
          <ul>
              <li><b>Samples in columns</b>: 
              The sample matched pairs are provided in
              two columns, and the two values in a matched pair
              are provided in the same row.  
              Select the column containing values of
              the first sample in <b>First Sample:</b> drop-down menu.
              Select the column containing values of the second sample 
              in <b>Second Sample:</b> drop-down menu.
              <li><b>Summarized Sample Data</b>: The sample size,
              mean, and standard deviation
              are provided (instead of individual sample values).</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          The significance level or confidence level must be between 0 and 1.  For example,
          enter 0.95 for a 95% confidence level.
      </p>
      <p>
          The <b>Alternative Hypothesis</b> can be one of the following forms:
          <b>Less than</b> (<i>&mu; &lt; 
          &mu;<sub>d</sub></i>), <b>Not Equal to</b> (<i>&mu; 
          &ne; &mu;<sub>d</sub></i>), or <b>Greater than</b>
      (<i>&mu; &gt; &mu;<sub>d</sub></i>).  Enter the <b>Hypothesized
      Mean Difference</b> (hypothesized mean of differences for the population of all
      matched pairs)  in
      the provided text box.
