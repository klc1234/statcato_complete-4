      <h1>Statistics > Hypothesis Tests > 1-Population Variance</h1>
      This utility performs calculations for testing claims about a population
      variance (or standard deviation).  The population is assumed to have a
      normal distribution.  The null hypothesis of a claim about a
      population variance <i>&sigma;<sup>2</sup></i> is 
      <i>&sigma = &sigma<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>.  The alternative
      hypothesis can be one of the following: <i>&sigma; &lt; &sigma;<sub>0</sub></i>,
      <i>&sigma; &gt; &sigma;<sub>0</sub></i>, or 
      <i>&sigma; &ne; &sigma;<sub>0</sub></i>.
  </p>
  <p>The test statistic is computed using the following formula:
  </p>

  </center>
  <p>
      where <i>s</i> is the sample standard deviation, &sigma;
      is the hypothesized population standard deviation, 
      and <i>n</i> is the sample size.
  </p>

  <p>
      To use the utility, follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ul>

  <li>If individual samples are entered in a single column of the 
  Datasheet, select the <b>Samples in column:</b> radio button, and
  select the column name in the drop-down menu.</li>
  <li>To use summary statistics of the sample data, select the 
  <b>Summarized sample data:</b> radio button, and input the sample size
in the provided text field.  Select the <b>Variance</b> radio button
 to provide the sample variance, and enter the sample variance in the 
 given text field.  To provide the sample standard deviation, select
the <b>Standard deviation</b> radio button and input it in the corresponding
text field.</li>
    <li>Enter the significance or confidence level (between 0 and 1).</li>
    <li>Select the form of the alternative hypothesis in the
    <b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b> drop-down menu.  Enter the 
    hypothesized population variance in the provided text box.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to perform the computation.  The 
    results will be displayed in the log window.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Sample Outputs</h3>
  <p>
      The null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are displayed.
      The results, along with the input parameters, are displayed in a table.
      <br>
      [N = sample size; Sample Stdev s = sample standard deviation 
      calculated from the individual samples
      or provided directly by the user; Sample Var s2 = sample variance;
      Significance Level = 1 - confidence level; Critical Value = 
      critical value corresponding to the significance level; 
      Test Statistic = test statistic corresponding to the hypothesized variance; 
      p-Value = p-Value corresponding to the test statistic]
