      <h1>Statistics > Hypothesis Tests > Hypothesis Test Conclusion Tool</h1>
      <p>
  The Hypothesis Test Conclusion Tool makes the initial conclusion of whether
  to reject the null hypothesis of a hypothesis test and gives the wording
  of the final conclusion of the test.  To use this tool, you
  give the original claim in symbolic form (e.g. mean &le; 3, proportion &ne; 0.5)
  and provide the appropriate values for either the traditional or the 
  p-Value approaches.  Based on the original claim, this tool determines the 
  null and alternative hypotheses and the type of test (left-tail, right-tail,
  or two-tail).  The conclusion will be based on either the critical value 
  and test statistic (traditional method) or the significance level
  and p-Value (p-Value method).
    </p>
    <h4>Original Claim</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Select the name of the population parameter in the 
        <b>Parameter</b> drop-down menu.  You may also enter a customized name
    in the drop-down box.</li>
    <li>Select the comparison operator (&lt;, &le;, &gt;, &ge;, =, &ne;)
    in the <b>Condition</b> drop-down menu.
    </li>
    <li>Enter the hypothesized value in the <b>Value</b> text field.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Next</b> button for the next step.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Hypotheses and Sample Statistics</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The original claim, null hypothesis, and alternative hypothesis are 
    displayed in this section.  A diagram indicating the type of test 
is also displayed.</li>
    <li>Select the method for determining conclusion:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Traditional Method</b>: Enter the critical value and 
            test statistic.  If the test statistic falls in the critical 
            region (as determined by the critical value), reject the null
            hypothesis; otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
            <li><b>p-Value Method</b>: Enter the significance level and 
            p-Value.  If the p-Value is less than or equal to the significance
            level &alpha;, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, fail to 
        reject the null hypothesis.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Click the <b>Next</b> button for the next step.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The initial conclusion of whether the null hypothesis is rejected
        is shown.</li>
        <li>The final conclusion about the original claim is also 
        displayed.</li>
    </ul>
